# ExoticMalware
Malware rewritten in exotic languages, such as Dlang and Vlang. By rewriting these programs in exotic languages their binaries will not be detected as malware by most antiviruses.

## Making a pull request
```
1) Make a folder with the malware's name
2) Put the source material in the folder you just created 
(if there is no source material then specify it by creating a README.MD file in your directory)
3) Make another folder with the name of the exotic language and put the rewritten code in it

ExampleMalware
    -source.py
    Dlang
        -rewritten.d
```

You can repeat step number 3 as much as you like with different languages (this is encoraged)
```
ExampleMalware
    -source.py
    Dlang
        -rewritten.d
    Vlang
        -rewritten.v
    Golang
        -rewritten.go
    ...
```

It is also really encoraged to add a README.MD file to any 
folder you check in describing what the malware does.

## What counts as an exotic language?
This is mostly up to common sense but some languages I encorage are
```
Dlang
Vlang
Golang
Rust
Brainfuck (if you can manage)
Nim
```

Languages that will not be accepted are
```
Assembly
C/C++
Java
C#
F#
Basic/VB
PHP (:/)
Python
Perl
Swift
Kotlin
Ruby
```
Everything here is up for debate so feel free to create an issue if you feel any of this information is wrong

## Warning
Any binaries (.exe, .jar, etc...) is strictly forbidden to check in. All PR's 
with any executables will be denied.
