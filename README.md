# ExoticMalware
Malware rewritten in exotic languages, such as Dlang and Vlang. By rewriting these programs in exotic languages their binaries will not be detected as malware by most antiviruses.

## Making a pull request
```
1) Make a folder with the malware's name.
2) Put the source material in the folder you just created 
(if there is no source material then specify it by creating a README.MD file in your directory).
3) Make another folder with the name of the exotic language and put the rewritten code in it.
4) Create a README.md file in the exotic lang directory detailing what the program does,
how to compile it, what dependencies it needs, and wether or not you checked in any binaries.

(Do not check in the malware binaries just dependencies (jar, dll, ...))

ExampleMalware
    -source.py
    Dlang
        -rewritten.d
    -README.md
```

You can repeat step number 3 as much as you like with different languages (this is encoraged)
```
ExampleMalware
    -source.py
    Dlang
        -rewritten.d
    Vlang
        -rewritten.v
    Golang
        -rewritten.go
    ...
    -README.md
```

## What counts as an exotic language?
This is mostly up to common sense but some languages I encorage are
```
Dlang
Vlang
Golang
Rust
Brainfuck (if you can manage)
Nim
```

Languages that will not be accepted are
```
Assembly
C/C++
Java
C#
F#
Basic/VB
PHP (:/)
Python
Perl
Swift
Kotlin
Ruby
```
Everything here is up for debate so feel free to create an issue if you feel any of this information is wrong.
